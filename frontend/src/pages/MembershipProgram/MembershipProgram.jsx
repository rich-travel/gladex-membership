              Feedback Submission: Encourage your loyalty card members to report
              their vacation experiences, both positive and negative, to your
              travel agency through their dedicated agents.

              Incentive: Provide an incentive for members to share their
              experiences by offering them Gift Vouchers for each feedback
              submission, regardless of whether it was a positive or negative
              experience.

            <p>
              Turning Negatives into Positives: By rewarding members for sharing

              are committed to improving their future travel experiences.

              Enhanced Customer Loyalty: This program can increase member
              engagement and loyalty by creating a feedback loop that

            <p>
              Improved Services: Gathering feedback from your members allows you
              to identify areas for improvement and make necessary adjustments
              to enhance the overall quality of your services.
